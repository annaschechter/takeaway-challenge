Makers Academy challenge week2

This project is for designing a takeaway restaurant system with the following functionality: 

* listing dishes with prices
* placing the order which will (i.e. accepting dish names with quantities)
* confirming order by sending a text message to the customer, the text message will confirm that the order has been placed and tell customer by what time it will be delivered (within an hour) 
e.g "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52"
